## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types or speaks symptoms into the interface.  
2. The system processes the input using NLP & ML models.  
3. The model predicts the likely disease.  
4. Recommendations for medication, precautions, workouts, and diet are generated.  
5. Results are displayed with a clean and interactive UI.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with real-time medical APIs (e.g., FDA Drug Database)  
- Add multilingual speech support  
- Improve prediction accuracy with deep learning  
- Enable user login and health history tracking
